This code file is the implementation of a [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12515) on the IDRiD dataset. <br>
Firstly, the IDRiD for disease grading is used and transformations like image resizing(256*256), cropping, contrast enhancement, normalization, rotation, and horizontal/vertical flipping have been applied to images. Transfer learning is applied on pre-trained EfficientNet(b0) and the number of outputs is set to the number of grades(0,1,2,3,4). Also, dropout(0.4) and batch normalization have been used(512) to overcome overfitting in the model. Adamax optimizer, which has achieved the best results in the paper, has been used with a learning rate of 0.002. As IDRiD suffers from class imbalance, the class weights are balanced using compute_class_weights() method. Training is done for 100 epochs and results are captured.<br>
The results show that the model is slightly overfitting as the train acc=76% and and test acc=55%. Likewise, the classwise accuracy deviates a lot. This error is solved in implementation 3.
