This repository is accumulation of all the learnings and results of experiments performed by me and my dearest team member <a href="https://github.com/tanishkaa19">tanishka kasal</a> during our internship in IAB Lab, IITJ. The only thing this repo doesn't capture is how our code didn't work for the zillionth time, how much time it took us to debug and check each and every line and others are blunders we did and never told our mentor(But we fixed that later). Eventually, it all lead us to code a chunk of lines in 10 mins which earlier took 2 hours.<br>
<h3>About</h3>
Our internship was based on working with fundus and OCT images. We worked on the IDRID dataset which comprises fundus images of an eyeball. Our main goal was to classify these images into four grades: grade 0(normal),1(mild),2(moderate),3(severe), and 4(proferilative). We implemented this using PyTorch and NVIDIA GPU 32 Gb memory. Now as IDRID is a small and imbalanced dataset, it took us quite a time to figure out that how can we achieve balanced accuracy. But as seen in implementation 3 we obtained a good >90% accuracy by using methods like transfer learning, dropout, batch normalization, stratified k-fold cross-validation applied on ResNet, VGGNet, AlexNet, and EfficientNet.
